# World_Weather_Analysis
## Project Overview
PlanMyTrip--a top travel technology company that specializes in internet-related services in the hotel and lodging industry--is beta testing a new app that collects and presents data for customers via the search page, which they will then filter based on their preferred travel criteria in order to find their ideal hotel, anywhere in the world.
## Resources
- Data Source: OpenWeather, Google Maps Platform
- Software: Python 3.7.13, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8
## Summary
### Weather Database
When reviewing the weather data on cities around the world, the beta testers requested that a current description of a city's weather be included in the summary in addition to the city's name, country, geo-coordinates, maximum temperature, humidity, cloud cover, and wind conditions. The beta testers were pleased that they could input a temperature range preference to further narrow down a sample of 672 cities pulled from the OpenWeather API Database.

### Vacation Search
The beta testers were also able to further narrow the sample by confirming the presence of an ideal hotel in addition to ideal weather conditions. They were then provided with a map they could use to visualize the geo-coordinates of the hotels suited to their tastes.

### Vacation Itinerary
Once the vacation destinations had been optimized, the beta testers were able to chart courses between hotels in multiple cities they might wish to visit by either driving, biking, or walking.

Overall, the PlanMyTrip app has done remarkably well through its beta testing phase and we are eagerly awaiting the final round of testing and the suggestions from our participants before we launch the finished product.
